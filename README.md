Pirate Intelligent Agent
Project Reflection: Deep Q-Learning Implementation
Work Completed in This Project
For this project, I was given a partial implementation of a Deep Q-Learning algorithm designed to navigate a maze and find an optimal path to a treasure cell. The provided code included:

A structured training function (qtrain) with key components such as exploration (epsilon), experience replay, and game mechanics.

A pseudocode template guiding the core logic for reinforcement learning.

A framework for printing epoch results and tracking the win rate over multiple training iterations.

The code I created involved completing the deep Q-learning logic, including:

Action selection using exploration (epsilon-greedy) or exploitation (highest Q-value prediction).

State observation and environment interaction to determine the reward and game status.

Experience replay implementation for batch training, ensuring stable Q-learning improvements.

Loss evaluation to refine model training over epochs.

Adaptive training adjustments, such as reducing epsilon after high win rates for more exploitation-based learning.

Connecting My Learning to Computer Science
Computer science is a problem-solving field, and the techniques applied in this Q-learning project align with core AI and software engineering principles.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? Computer scientists develop intelligent systems, optimize algorithms, and create technology-driven solutions that impact industries such as healthcare, finance, and automation. AI applications like reinforcement learning (used here) are crucial for autonomous systems, robotics, and adaptive decision-making.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? This project reinforced the structured problem-solving approach used in computer science:

Define the problem (Navigation through a maze to find an optimal path).

Break it down (Implement Q-learning principles, exploration vs. exploitation, memory storage).

Iterate through improvements (Fine-tune hyperparameters like epsilon, batch training size, and memory limits).

Test solutions in real-world simulations (Measure training performance through epochs and refine algorithm logic).

Ethical Responsibilities as a Computer Scientist
Ethical considerations in AI development play a major role in ensuring that intelligent systems function responsibly:

Transparency in AI decisions: Models should not make arbitrary decisions without explainability.

Data Privacy & Security: User interactions (e.g., experience replay in this project) should be secure and anonymized where applicable.

Bias Prevention: Reinforcement learning must avoid biased outcomesâ€”here, ensuring the training process does not unfairly favor certain maze paths is crucial.

User-Centric Design: AI applications should enhance, not replace, human decision-making by providing assistive technology rather than automated control.

Final Thoughts
This deep Q-learning implementation taught me how intelligent agents learn through experience, refining decision-making as training progresses. Beyond reinforcement learning, this approach applies broadly to AI-driven robotics, gaming, and adaptive automation systems. As I continue exploring AI in my computer science career, I aim to balance technical innovation with ethical responsibility, ensuring that AI-driven solutions optimize efficiency without compromising fairness or transparency.
